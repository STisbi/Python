# Python
The Python Forge

## Overview
This repository is a general purpose repository for housing all Python projects. Mainly used for getting familiar with ideas/API's/topics, testing ideas, and other non-specific project projects. Each directory holds .py modules that fall under the jurisdiction of that directory.

### AI Algorithms
This directory holds modules related to AI. Currently this includes basic probability calculators.

### Common Use
A directory to hold all modules that used more than once, for example reading from a file.

### Dynamic Programming
Modules here relate to dynamic programming algorithms.

### Egg
Modules testing Python Egg functionality.

### GUI
Modules experimenting with the Python's GUI API

### Greedy Algorithms
Modules here relate to algorithms that fall under this branch, such as Dijkstra.

### ParseXML
Modules relating to parsing XML files

### Regular Expressions
Modules relating to using, testing, and applying Python's regular expressions.

### Sorting Algorithms
Modules relating to general sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort.

### Test Files
This directory holds input files required by the other modules. Created so that any run configuration will be similar in path (except the file name).
